## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

PhantomStrike automates offensive recon across **15 attack phases**, covering:

| Phase | Name                                      | Summary |
|-------|-------------------------------------------|---------|
| 1     | Network Scanner                            | DNS resolution, basic port scan |
| 2     | Passive Recon                              | HTML scraping, comment leaks |
| 3     | Firebase Exposure                          | Firebase API key & config leak checker |
| 4     | Cookie Flag Analyzer                       | Checks for missing `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite` |
| 5     | SSRF Fuzzer                                | Fuzzes common SSRF parameters |
| 6     | JavaScript Scanner                         | Extracts secrets & suspicious vars from JS |
| 7     | JWT Token Decoder                          | Decodes and prints JWT structure |
| 8     | Open Redirect Checker                      | Looks for redirector params |
| 9     | S3 Bucket & Subdomain Finder               | Scans for open S3 URLs and subdomains |
| 10    | Custom Phase Placeholder                   | Expand with your own logic |
| 11    | JWT Algo Confusion + Kid Injection         | Tests for weak JWT header configs |
| 12    | DOM XSS / CSP Checker                      | Flags insecure DOM sinks & missing CSP headers |
| 13    | GCP/AWS/Azure Role Abuse                   | Detects insecure IAM configurations |
| 14    | Burp-Compatible Passive Proxy (Stub)       | Hook for MITM proxy integration |
| 15    | Wordlist Generator                         | Extracts keywords from HTML & JS for fuzzing/brute forcing |
